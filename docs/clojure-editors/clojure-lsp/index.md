## Install

Follow your preferred option on the [Clojure LSP installation guide](https://clojure-lsp.io/installation/)

Practicalli downloads the clojure-lsp-native-linux-amd64.zip file from [GitHub release page](https://github.com/clojure-lsp/clojure-lsp/releases)and extracts the `clojure-lsp` binary to `~/.local/bin/clojure-lsp`.

`clojure-lsp --version` in a terminal will test if the the install is working.

??? HINT "Editors may install Clojure LSP for you"
    Spacemacs LSP layer will prompt to install a language server when first opening a file of a major mode where LSP is enabled.  E.g. when a Clojure related file is opened, the Clojure LSP server is downloaded if not installed (or not found on the Emacs path).

    VSCode Calva plugin includes the clojure-lsp server, although an external server can be configured.
